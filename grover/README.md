1. Apply the current experiment to the real quantum computer. (IBM machine)  
2. Coloring problem (QC generator). Instead of transforming the problem into CNF, use circuit-based method to construct the oracle.  
3. Coloring problem runtime analysis. (max #color in UNSAT / min #color in SAT)  
4. How many times of measurement gaurantee the expected probability of correctnes? If too many, how to reduce?  
5. Finite machine in quantum configuration.  
6. Trade-off between circuit length and #ancillaries.  
7. Without knowing |ONSET|, how many iterations are needed?  
8. When |ONSET| = N/2, can we change the input superposition weights to get the solution?
