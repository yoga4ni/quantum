Apply the current experiment to the real quantum computer. (IBM machine)
Coloring problem (QC generator). Instead of transforming the problem into CNF, use circuit-based method to construct the oracle.
Coloring problem runtime analysis. (max #color in UNSAT / min #color in SAT)
How many times of measurement gaurantee the expected probability of correctness? If too many, how to reduce?
Finite machine in quantum configuration.
Trade-off between circuit length and #ancillaries.
Without knowing |ONSET|, how many iterations are needed?
When |ONSET| = N/2, can we change the input superposition weights to get the solution?
